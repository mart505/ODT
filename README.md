# ODT
Optimal Decision Trees.
The files in this repository are used to compute the numerical results for my bachelor thesis.

The main programme is ODT.py, which constructs decision trees and executes the optimisation using IBM CPLEX.\n
This file needs DataProcessing.py to read the data files and fetch all the parameters.\n
All Other files are data files.\n

In the ODT file, you can edit to specificy what dataset, what tree topology and what options you want for the optimisation

Kind regards,

Martijn Korf
