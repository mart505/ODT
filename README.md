# ODT
These files are the code I used to compute the numerical results for my bachelor thesis.

The main programme is ODT.py , which constructs decision trees and executes the optimisation using IBM CPLEX.\\
This file needs DataProcessing.py to read the data files and fetch all the parameter.\\ 

Note that the data files need to be in the same folder for the programme to function properly.
